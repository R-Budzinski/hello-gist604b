## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to navigate GitHubâ€™s interface, including creating repositories, committing changes, and using branches effectively.
- The importance of using Issues to track documentation, bugs, and enhancments, which helps teams stay organized and collaborate more efficiently.
- Documentation is essential in open source projects because it helps users understand how the project is created and where they got there information from.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced was the Verify File Structure failed 

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills will support my GIS career by helping me build a professional portfolio that showcases my work with open-source tools. As someone working in local government, collaboration features in GitHub will make it easier to coordinate with other agencies across the state, share code and data workflows, and contribute to regional or statewide geospatial initiatives. These skills also position me to participate in open-source projects that benefit public safety and community planning.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
